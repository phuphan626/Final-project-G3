* Project topic: Prediction of Cryptocurrency - Bitcoin
https://bitcoinfinalproject.herokuapp.com/
# Team Members:
* Winnie Yim
* Steve Wen Lin
* Ryan Shahid
* Phu Phan
# Hypothesis:
* The goals of this project are to use ML in order to predict next-day Bitcoin price, using a Linear regression model and the pricing trend (either up or down) by using a Logistic Regression model. Bitcoin is the largest and most popular cryptocurrency in the market where prices have sky-rocketed over the past couple of years. Our website aims to provide someone new to the market or interested in cryptocurrency to see Bitcoin's background and information as well as data visualizations that compare Bitcoin to other crypto coins. It also has an explanation of the Features used for the prediction models and its relative importance as a feature for prediction.
     The Final page of the project showcases the next day predicted price of Bitcoin and trend of the prices, using a web scraping method to showcase the current price of real-time Bitcoin and price trend along with with the other cryptocurrencies. Sci-kit learn imports and JS were important tools for scraping and showcasing the data into the model in order to display the visualizations. Further data visualizations were shown via Tableau. The main body of the code can be seen through the Jupyter notebook python script that displays the linear and regression model testing, the Recursive Feature Selection process that tested our features, and the R-square adjusted outputs that informed the accuracy of the models and correlation factor of our data variables. The model was tested using a data frame of 2013-2018 data to predict using a time frame of current 2020 data to predict the next day.
